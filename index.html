        <h3>Front-end Development and Programming</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code when I was 10, when my dad taught me a bit of programming in Basic on our Atari 800
        computer. It didn't really catch on with me then, but when I was 27 I took a Java class and really liked it, but
        yet I didn't stick with it, even though I was a front-end developer for a company for 15 years.</p>

        <h3>Roller Coasters</h3>
        <p>One of my biggest passions since I was a kid is riding rollercoasters. I have been on
        more than 60 of them throughout California.</p>
